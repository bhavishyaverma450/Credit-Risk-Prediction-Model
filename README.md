📊 Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction system to analyze borrower data and evaluate loan approval risk using multiple machine learning models.

🎯 Project Objective

To compare the performance of different regression and classification algorithms and identify the most reliable model for credit risk assessment based on real-world data.

🔍 Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values and categorical encoding

Feature scaling for improved model performance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using correlation heatmaps

Model comparison using multiple evaluation metrics

Model serialization for reuse and deployment

🤖 Models Implemented

Regression Models
